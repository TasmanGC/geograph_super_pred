## geo_graph supervised prediction
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

**geo_graph supervised prediction** shows a workflow for using non graph structured geoscience data in **Graph Neural Networks** as implemented using <a href="(https://github.com/dmlc/dgl">Deep Graph Library</a>. Inclusive in this repo is a process to generate a simplistic geo_graph using synthetic data. Due to the 3D nature of the dataset 3D visualisation is handled using <a href="(https://docs.pyvista.org/">pyvista.</a>
